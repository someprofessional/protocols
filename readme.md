# Protocols project
Here i'm going to put all the protocols that i learn to do in different languages.
The purpose of this repo is to learn how to do http, tcp, websocket and so on in multiple languages.

## Why tho ?
Well, i like learning new languages and i want to understand how to do these protocols in those languages. For fun.
I'm not particularly good in theses and i want to get better at them for work and for other purposes.

## Languages to implement with
Currently i want to implement them with :

    - Rust
    - Golang
    - Java
    - Elixir
    - C
